## Objectives
By the end of this experiment, you should be able to:
* design and test a PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) generator using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR)
* display 8-bit value on neopixel bar on Vbuddy
* specify a FSM (Finite State Machine) in SystemVerilog
* design a FSM to cycle through the Formula 1 starting light sequence
* understand how the **_clktick.sv_** module works, and calibrate it for 1 sec tick period
* automatically cycle through F1 lights at 1 second interval
* optionally implement the full F1 starting light machine and test your reaction. - task 4 (massive)
